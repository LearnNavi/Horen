This is a live to-do list for the English version of the Horen.  Some
of these matters will take Paul Frommer's input, some are just a
matter of tidying up or incorporating material from his email and blog
posts.

Things can be deleted once they're finished.


# Ongoing
Long-running maintenance and improvements.


1. There are a lot of citations that are still only LaTeX comments.
More should be lifted out of the comments with the citation macros.

2. Examples.  Some sections are good on this, others less so.  If an
additional example (by preference from Paul) can be clarifying, it
should be included.

3. Some areas could use more indexing.


# Incorporating Old Stuff (sometimes just needs detail refinement)

1. Habitual: https://forum.learnnavi.org/language-updates/the-continuous-aspect-vs-the-habitual-aspect/


# New Matters 
Questions that will definitely require judgement from Paul, or are are
response to his blog.


## 2020dec04 (wm)

Verb dropping preserves case structure? Also, in answers to questions?

   A: Tsame'a ayngal 'upet?
   B: Sawtutet.

Is this acceptible style?

   Oel yolom teylut, yerikit pol.
   I ate grubs, she (ate) hexapede.

(See http://naviteri.org/2020/02/some-words-for-leap-year-day/ on
'tok' for partial inspiration to this question).

Also incorporate "Negative Questions in Na'vi" into that section:

## 2020dec05 (Wm, Mako)

Add an entire section on the copulas, to locate all that info in one
place.  Right now, it is spread out.

## 2020dec05 (Wm)

Ask questions about how one could use the topical with lu and slu to
resolve some ambiguities that come from free constituent order.
Examples should go with the question.


## 2020dec05 (Wm)

Really, longer texts from Paul exist now, and should be mined for
useful things to say about the topical.


## 2020dec05 (Wm)

The forms of tsa'u!  sat? tseyä?


## 2020dec30 Dative or {ta} with pawm? (Discord)

## 2021jan04 fìpo vs. fì'u with animals (wm)

We know what to do with respect to po[1], but I'm not sure how to best
deploy the question words and demonstratives. 

  Fì'u lu peu?
    Fì'u lu tskxe.
  Fì'u lu peu?  (Fìpo lu pesu?)
    Fì'u lu tute.  (Fìpo lu tute.)
    (Fìpo lu Neytiri.)
  Fì'u lu peu?  (Fìpo lu pesu?)
    Fì'u lu riti.  (Fìpo lu riti.)
  nantang? fwäkì? ikran?
